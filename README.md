Colorimeter App
Accurate Color Measurement, Perfected.

Tired of mobile color measurement apps that give inconsistent, uncorrected results? Our Colorimeter App is your ultimate solution for precise, reliable color measurement using advanced calibration techniques.

🎯 Overview
This app enables accurate color measurement of physical objects by implementing sophisticated color correction algorithms. Whether you're matching paint colors, digitizing brand colors, or conducting color analysis, our app delivers professional-grade results.

✨ Key Features
Dual Measurement Modes:

All Mode: Combine all datasets for comprehensive analysis

Each Mode: Analyze individual datasets separately

Advanced Color Correction: Implements white and black reference calibration for accurate color reproduction

Multi-Contributor Dataset: Leverages data collected under various lighting conditions for robust performance

⚠️ Important Note
Dataset Compatibility: The Tai02 dataset uses a black reference sheet instead of white reference. Please exclude this dataset when using the All Mode to ensure consistent results.
